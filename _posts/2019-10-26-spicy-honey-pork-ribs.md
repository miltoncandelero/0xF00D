## Ingredients
- 1 kg of pork ribs
- 125 cc of honey
- 80 cc of [Teriyaki sauce](https://miltoncandelero.github.io/0xF00D/teriyaki-sauce/)
- 40 cc of Sriracha sauce
- 80 cc of tomato pur√© (optional)
- Salt 1 tablespoon
- Sugar 2 tablespoon
- Sweet paprika powder 2 tablespoon

## Preparation
0. Remove the silverskin from under the ribs by pulling real hard.
1. Mix the dry ingredients (salt, sugar and sweet paprika powder) in a cup.
  - Same amount of each.
2. In a bowl big enough to fit your ribs later mix the wet ingredients (honey, teriyaki and sriracha).
3. Taste that. It might feel too spicy, it will die down in the oven but:
  - If it tastes too salty: add honey.
  - If it doesn't burn: add sriracha.
  - If it doesn't make your mouth water: add teriyaki
4. Into that bowl add your ribs and get your hands dirty.
  - Make sure that pork is all wet and sticky.
5. Pour your dry ingredients from the cup into that bowl and keep rubbing.
  - Make sure that pork is now all coarse because of the sugar and red because of the sweet paprika.
6. Transfer the pork and whatever might remain on the bowl to a oven safe container (or an oven bag).
7. Cook covered for an hour at medium-low heat.
  - Covered means with tinfoil or inside an oven bag.
  - Try to balance the ribs on their side.
8. Remove the cover, raise the heat to medium-kinda-high and cook from another hour.
  - Keep those ribs on their side
9. Every 15 min or so bathe the ribs with their own juice.
10. When it's done, turn the oven off, cut the ribs into individual ribs and roll them in the remaining sauce. Return to the oven for 5 more minutes to allow for a bit of cooling and thickening of the glaze.

There you go, spicy honey ribs.
