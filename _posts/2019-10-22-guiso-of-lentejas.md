_(Stew of minced meat and lentils)_

## Ingredients
- Half a kilo minced meat
- One _chorizo parrillero_ (barbecue thick sausage kinda thing)
- Two carrots
- Half a kilo of onions (A bit more is ok too).
- 500cc beaf stock (You can use a fancy stock if you feel like it or just about any stock)
- 500cc tomato puré (From a box, a bottle or a can. I don't give a shit)
- Hot sauce (if you like spicy)
- 200 gr lentils (More or less a coffee mug)
- One garlic tooth. (They look like fangs, not like cloves anyway).
- Two bay leaves

Serves two normal people or one thicc bear.

## Preparation
0. If you have dry lentils, soak them overnight.
1. Chop the onion into little cubes
2. Chop the carrots in not so little cubes (smaller than just rounds, bigger than the onions).
  - You won't need the carrots asap, but is easier if you cut them now.
3. Throw your minced meat, chorizo filling and onions into your dry pot. Put on heavy fire and stir until all the meat looks somewhat brown and cooked.
4. Put your fire to minimum and add
  - The carrots
  - The tomato puré
  - The beef stock
  - The garlic tooth (Whole, crushed or minced. The more you cut and destroy the garlic, the more flavor it will give)
  - The bay leaves (Whole, no mincing. You will take them out when you are plating. *Bonus game:* The person who gets the bay leaf has to do the dishes after)
  - A squirt of hot sauce (You know how much heat you can take. You ought to be a big boy or girl here).
5. If you had dry lentils soaking from overnight, strain them and put them in the pot too.
  - If you are using pre-cooked ones (from example from a can) you put them at the very end or you will overcook them.
6. Let cook with your fire to the minimum for 2 hours or until it gets really thicc.
  - Stir occasionally to avoid sticking
  - If you have a really thin pot the heat might focus, in that case you need a heat spreader. Like a round thick disk that heats evenly and transfer the even heat to the crappy pot.
7. After you think it is thicc enough turn off the fire.
  - If you had pre-cooked lentils, add them now. (Keep the fire off).
  
There you go, Guiso de lentejas.
