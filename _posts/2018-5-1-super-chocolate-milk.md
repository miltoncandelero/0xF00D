## Ingredients
- Half-and-Half (Whole milk + Heavy cream)
- Cocoa powder
- Sugar
- Pinch of salt
- Pinch of ground cinnamon
- Instant coffee
- Whipped cream (Extra cream and _whip it, whip it good_)
- Dark Chocolate (Full cocoa butter is better, we want it runny)
- 1/4 tsp corn starch per cup (Optional. This makes our milk one thicc chunky girl)

### Where the fuck are the amounts?
Why didn't I put the amounts? Except salt and cinnamon that we need just a pinch, we need to use common sense here.

For each cup of Half-and-Half put the corresponding amount of cocoa powder, sugar, coffee and dark chocolate you would use in a regular breakfast chocolate milk (and then some).


## Preparation
0. Put your half-and-half in a saucepan.
1. Heat and whisk while heating (The more you wisk, the foamier it gets). Heat to steaming hot but not boiling (Not the end of the world if it boils a little).
2. Put the fire suuuuuper low now!
3. Add the cocoa powder, coffee, and sugar, stir to dissolve.
4. Add the corn starch.
  - WAIT YOU MONSTER! Mix it with a small amount of **COLD** milk.
  - Then add that milk to the mix.
  - You can never add corn starch to a hot liquid you dum-dum.
5. If you need to whip your cream, put the sugar into the cream now so it begins to dissolve.
6. Add the pinches (salt and cinnamon), stir.
7. Add the Dark Chocolate, stir until fully melted and combined (break it into little pieces for easier melting).
8. Kill the heat, put the lid and let rest for a while.
  - Use that time to whip your cream if needed.
9. Pour your Super Chocolate Milk into a cup, top with wipped cream and you are good to go.

One way trip to chocolate induced alucinations coming right up!
