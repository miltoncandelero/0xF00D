_(based on ["Pies 'n' Thighs Apple Pie" from bon app√©tit](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/pies-n-thighs-apple-pie))_

## Ingredients
- 1.5 kg of apples (tartness to taste. I like red ones)
- 25 gr of butter (1/4 if you have 100gr sticks or 1/8 if you have 200gr sticks)
- 1/2 cup of sugar
- juice of 1 lemon (please strain the seeds, you caveman)
- 1 teaspoon of cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon of allspice (A.K.A. Jamaican pepper)
- 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon of grated nutmeg (fresh grated? eyeball it)
- 2 tablespoons of flour (the regular one, you just need it to thicken the juice)

### Only the filling? and you tag this as a full recipe?
Go to the supermarket and buy puff pastry, pie rounds, or however they are called in your country.

## Preparation
0. Juice the lemon and add to a big fridge safe bowl (Tupperware or whatever).
1. Peel, core, and slice the apples (wedges, rounds, wedges the other way, cubes, anything works). Add them to the bowl.
  - Make sure you dip and roll the just sliced apples in the lemon juice. This will prevent the apples from oxidizing (turning brown).
2. Cut your butter into somewhat small dices, thin slices, or something to help it mix and melt easier and add it to the bowl.
3. Add everything that you didn't add yet to the bowl (yah, just dump everything in).
4. Mix everything as well as you can.
5. Refrigerate overnight
  - When you add sugar to fruits and you let that rest, you extract the juice and soften them.
6. The next day (or whenever you are assembling this), split the solids from the juice you **will** have in your cold mixture.
  - You might be tempted to drop your apples into the pie dough, but don't. We still need to do some more mixing.
  - Also, it might be a good idea to turn the oven on now to preheat it.
7. Put the juice into a pot over the fire and reduce until you get a syrupy consistency.
  - Think honey or maple syrup, runny but not liquid.
  - Too thick and you won't be able to mix it, too thin and it will make your pie soggy.
8. Mix the syrupy juice back with the apples.
9. Now we put our filling in the pie dough.
  - If you are making a closed pie, make sure you make venting holes or you will end up with a balloon pie (Nobody likes balloon pies).
  - Also, brush your top pie with egg yolk and sprinkle sugar or kosher salt to get extra *gourmety* on your pie
10. Bake until crust is golden.
  - The filling doesn't need any cooking, if the dough is cooked you are good to go.
11. Ideally, let cool and serve with Ice-Cream.
  - What the USA calls "vanilla" ice cream and we call "American cream" ice cream. The white sweet one that doesn't taste like anything but sweet.
  - The original recipe called for a slice of cheddar cheese instead. I like wacky salty-sweet combos and of course, I tried it: far from the worst I've tasted but didn't see the appeal.
